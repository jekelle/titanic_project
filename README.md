# Titanic Survival Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of the Titanic dataset (Kaggle) as part of a data science assignment.

## Overview

This project addresses two exercises:

1. **Survival Patterns**  
   - Grouped passengers by class, sex, and age group  
   - Calculated survival rates  
   - Visualized survival patterns with Plotly and Streamlit

2. **Family Size and Wealth**  
   - Created a family size feature  
   - Explored relationships between class, family size, and fare  
   - Extracted last names to count families

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install pandas plotly streamlit
